    <p id="a"><b>asynchronous</b> Operation is a non-blocking operations. Instead of waiting for a task to complete before moving on to the next one, JavaScript allows you to execute asynchronous operations and continue with other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous task to finish.</p>
    <p id="b"><b>Callbacks</b> in JavaScript are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after the completion of a particular operation or task. Callbacks are a way to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API, reading files, or handling user input.</p>
    <p id="c"><b>Promises</b> in JavaScript are a mechanism for handling asynchronous operations. They provide a cleaner and more structured way to work with asynchronous code compared to callbacks. A Promise represents a value that might be available now, or in the future, or never. Promises have three states: pending, resolved (fulfilled), or rejected.</p>
    <p id="d">Async/Await is particularly useful for handling asynchronous operations in a sequential and straightforward manner.Async/Await is built on top of Promises and provides a more concise way to work with asynchronous code, making it look more like synchronous code.
        <b>async</b> - indicating that it contains asynchronous code.
        <b>await</b> - keyword is used to wait for the fetchData Promise to be resolved or rejected.</p>
    <p id="e"> <b>Closure</b> is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This environment consists of the variables that were in scope at the time the closure was created. Closures allow a function to access and manipulate variables from its outer (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished execution.</p>
    <p id="f">A <b>higher-order</b> function in JavaScript is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result.</p>
    <P id="g">The <b>preventDefault()</b> method is used to stop the default behavior of an event. For example, when you submit a form, the default behavior is to reload the page. By calling event.preventDefault(), you can prevent this default behavior from occurring.</P>
    <p id="h"><b>JSON</b> (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is a text format that is language-independent.JSON represents data as key-value pairs similar to object literals in JavaScript.</p>
    <p id="i">A <b>constructor function</b> in JavaScript is a special type of function that is used to create and initialize objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating multiple instances of similar objects with the same properties and methods.</p>
    <p id="j">
        <b>Callback</b> hell in JavaScript refers to a situation where you have multiple nested callbacks within asynchronous functions, leading to deeply nested and often hard-to-read code. This typically occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations such as reading files, making API requests, or handling events.</p>
